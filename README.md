## Features

### User Authentication

An important feature of Bruin Dating is that only students at UCLA are able to access it. To do this users will be required to use their UCLA email to sign up for Bruin Dating. Users will also be required to use DUO Mobile authentication to verify that it is you who is logging in or signing up. 

### How to meet people

After you fill out the questionnaire an algorithm is used to show you the profile of a potential match and you will be able to swipe left or right (ignore or like). When both of you give each other a like you will unlock the ability to message each other with the built in chat feature.
